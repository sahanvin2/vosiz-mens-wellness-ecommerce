## 📝 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Gmail SMTP Configuration
You need to configure Gmail SMTP in your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@vosiz.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Vosiz - Men's Wellness"
```

### Step 2: Create Gmail App Password
1. **Go to Google Account Settings**: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Security Tab**: Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
3. **2-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA if not already enabled
4. **App Passwords**: Search for "App passwords" in settings
5. **Generate Password**: 
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other" for device and enter "Vosiz Website"
   - Copy the 16-character password (format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)
6. **Update .env**: Replace `your-app-password` with the generated password

### Step 3: Update Email Settings
Replace these values in your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace with your actual Gmail address
MAIL_USERNAME=youremail@gmail.com

# Replace with the 16-character app password from Gmail
MAIL_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop

# You can customize these
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@vosiz.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Vosiz - Men's Wellness"
```

### Route Protection
```php
// All these routes require email verification:
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', ...);
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'admin'])->group(function () {
    // Admin routes
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'supplier'])->group(function () {
    // Supplier routes  
});
```

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

### Test Email Sending (Development)
For testing purposes, you can temporarily use Laravel's log driver:

```env
# For testing only - emails will be logged instead of sent
MAIL_MAILER=log
```

Then check `storage/logs/laravel.log` to see the email content.

### Test with Real Gmail
1. Set up Gmail SMTP as described above
2. Register a new test account
3. Check your Gmail sent folder
4. Check the test email inbox for verification email

### Test the Flow
1. **Register**: Create new account at `/register`
2. **Verification Page**: Should redirect to email verification page
3. **Check Email**: Look for Vosiz verification email
4. **Click Link**: Click verification button in email
5. **Success**: Should be verified and redirected to dashboard

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Queue Workers (Recommended)
For better performance, run queue workers to process emails in background:

```bash
# Start queue worker
php artisan queue:work

# Or use supervisor/systemd for production
```

### Email Logs
Monitor email sending in `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Database
The `email_verified_at` column in `users` table tracks verification status.

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Email Template
Edit `resources/views/emails/verify-email.blade.php` to customize:
- Colors and styling
- Content and messaging
- Logo and branding
- Call-to-action buttons

### Verification Page  
Edit `resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php` to customize:
- Page design
- Instructions text
- Button styling
- Additional features

### Expiration Time
Change verification link expiration in `config/auth.php`:

```php
'verification' => [
    'expire' => 60, // minutes
],
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid Credentials" Error**
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
   - Use App Password, not regular password
   - Check username/password in .env

2. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
   - Verify SMTP settings
   - Test with `MAIL_MAILER=log` first

3. **Emails Going to Spam**
   - Use reputable email service
   - Set proper FROM address
   - Consider using dedicated email service like Mailgun

4. **Verification Links Not Working**
   - Check APP_URL in .env matches your domain
   - Ensure routes are cleared: `php artisan route:clear`
   - Check link hasn't expired

### Alternative Email Services

Instead of Gmail, you can use:

#### Mailgun (Recommended for Production)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=mailgun
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-domain.mailgun.org
MAILGUN_SECRET=your-mailgun-api-key
```

#### SendGrid
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
```
